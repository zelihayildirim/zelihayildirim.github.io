<h4>CN Tower</h4>
<p>Its name "CN" originally referred to Canadian National.</p>
<p>it was completed in 1976, and held the record for the world's tallest free-standing structure for 32 years from 1975â€“2007 and was the world's tallest tower until 2009 being overtaken by Burj Khalifa and Canton Tower, respectively. It is now the third tallest tower in the world and remains the tallest free-standing structure in the Western Hemisphere, a signature icon of Toronto's skyline, attracting more than two million international visitors annually.</p>

<h4>Gooderham Building</h4>
<p>The Gooderham Building is the focal point of one of Toronto's most iconic vistas: looking west down Front Street towards the building's prominent rounded corner, framed on the sides by the heritage commercial blocks along Front Street, and with the skyscrapers of the Financial District towering in the background. The CN Tower is also visible from certain angles behind Brookfield Place. This vista frequently appears in imagery of the city.</p>
