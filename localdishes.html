    <h2>Cuisine in Toronto</h2>

    <p>
    	The cuisine of Toronto reflects Toronto's size and multicultural diversity.Different ethnic neighbourhoods throughout the city focus on specific cuisines, such as authentic Chinese and Vietnamese found in the city's six Chinatowns, Korean in Koreatown, Greek on The Danforth, Italian cuisine in Little Italy and Corso Italia, and Indian in Little India. Numerous other world cuisines are available throughout the city, including Portuguese, Hungarian, Japanese, and Caribbean. Toronto's large Jewish population has also ensured a variety of Jewish restaurants and delis, with varying adherence to kosher rules. In addition to ethnic cuisines, Toronto is also home to many fine dining establishments and chain restaurants ranging from fast food to casual or upscale dining.

    <h4> You can find every cuisine in Toronto, but there is one speacial food belongs to Toronto and that is <em>POUTINE</em> </h4>

    <img src="http://www.montanaclub.com/wp-content/uploads/2016/10/Poitine-food-page-1.png">

    <p>In the basic recipe for poutine, French fries are covered with fresh cheese curds, and topped with brown gravy.</p>
    <p>There are many variations of poutine. Some restaurants offer poutine with such toppings as sausage, chicken, bacon, brisket or Montreal-style smoked meat. Some poutineries even boast dozens of variations of poutine. More upscale poutine with three-pepper sauce, merguez sausage, foie gras or even caviar and truffle can be found, a pre-Millennium trend that is credited to David MacMillan of 'Joe Beef' and 'Globe' restaurants fame.</p>

    <h4> I would like to recommend one special and famous restaurant in Toronto which is <em>FRING'S</em></h4>

    <p>The place is absolutely amazing. Definitely worth to see!</p>
    <p>As for the food, the menu is described to me as having North American, European and a touch of Asian fusion influences, so I guess "international" encompasses all of that. They're a reflection of what the Bent-Lees love to eat, and from what I can gather, that's elevated comfort food.</p>
